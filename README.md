Turn-Based RPG Battle Manager

This repository contains a simple yet extensible Turn-Based RPG Battle Manager implemented in Java. The project demonstrates object-oriented design principles, game mechanics, and interaction loops suitable for a console-based RPG. It's designed to showcase programming skills relevant to game development, with a focus on flexibility and modularity.
